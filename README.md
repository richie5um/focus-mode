A simple package to enable/disable a _zen_ mode. When focus-mode is enabled, you can only have a single tab per pane, and, it toggles the tree-view.

Toggle using: ctrl-alt-z

* Open File: Cmd-P
  * Use this to see your tab history (most recently used at the top!)
* Switch to existing Open File: Cmd-B
  * Same as Open File, but, list of files is smaller. 
* Toggle TreeView: Cmd-\
* Next 'Tab': Cmd-Alt-RightArrow
  * Use this to quick change files (especially to re-open the 'Project Find Results' page, which isn't included in the open file
* Previous 'Tab': Cmd-Alt-LeftArrow
